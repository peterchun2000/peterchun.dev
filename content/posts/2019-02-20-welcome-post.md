Hey, Welcome to My Website!
------------

I programmed this website using the `Gatsby` framework, and built upon Victor Zhou's [opensource template](https://github.com/vzhou842/victorzhou.com) 

My goal here is not only to showcase what I've expereinced, but also the experience of others, which is why I also am planning to hire editors to write and comment on blog posts. 

This is actually my second version of my personal website. You can check out my previous version [here](https://radiant-tundra-27378.herokuapp.com/) and my previous blog [here](https://studentoverflow.herokuapp.com/posts/5), which both used `Ruby on Rails`.

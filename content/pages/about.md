I'm currently an undergrad computer science student at the University of Maryland. I began my CS fandom when I took AP computer science in highschool, and I absolutely fell in love with programming. Theres just something about designing, finding solutions, and fixing bugs that gets me excited to work (I might not even call it work). I've expanded my horizons and now have several languages under my belt: Java, Python, Ruby, HTML, CSS, and the Arduino language. I've dabbled in the art of mobile app development by working with frameworks like React Native and Flutter. There are much more I want to learn, so I'm looking forward to teaching myself machine learning in the comming weeks/months.
